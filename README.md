# Models_and_Toys
SQL queries from a mock database on a models and toys company

This is the result of a 3 week project developed with 3 other colleagues from the Wild Code School.
It was a project designed to improve our SQL skills while providing some visualization of our results.
We were asked to produce a Tableau or Power BI dashboard with a number of mandatory KPI and propose some others, as well as improvement suggestions for the company's database. We decided to use Tableau for our dashboard for compatibility.
The project constraint was to not use Tableau designed filters, but to provide all filters with our SQL queries. Tableau was to be used only for the visual aspect of our work.

Within this project, I was the Product Owner in addition to the development of my queries. This meant I had an overarching view of all queries performed, I chose what queries were to be included in the dashboard, and I also supervised the correct coding of all queries. Sometimes this meant I had to correct my colleague's code.
